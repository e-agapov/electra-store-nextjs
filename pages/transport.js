		No person is immune from falling off a scooter or bicycle, even if not through their own fault. For example, drivers sometimes do not look too carefully into the mirrors when opening the doors, and can open it right in front of the nose of a passing cyclist. Good equipment will protect you from injury, which can save your life.`
